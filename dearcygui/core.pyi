    Parent-Child Relationships:
    -------------------------
    The parent of an item can be set in several ways:
        1. Using the parent attribute: `item.parent = target_item`
        2. Passing `parent=target_item` during item creation

        4. Setting previous_sibling or next_sibling attributes to insert the item between existing siblings

    Tree Structure:
    --------------
        - Items are rendered in order from first child to last child
        - New items are inserted last by default unless previous_sibling/next_sibling is used
        - Items can be manually detached by setting parent = None
        - Most items have restrictions on what parents/children they can have
        - Some items can have multiple incompatible child lists that are concatenated when reading item.children

    The parent, previous_sibling and next_sibling relationships form a doubly-linked tree structure that determines rendering order and hierarchy.

    Special Cases:
    -------------
    Some items cannot be children in the rendering tree:
        - PlaceHolderParent: Can be parent to any item but cannot be in rendering tree

        Locking the mutex will prevent:
            - Other threads from reading/writing
            attributes or calling methods with this item,
            editing the children/parent of the item
            - Any rendering of this item and its children.
            If the viewport attemps to render this item,

        This is useful if you want to edit several attributes

        the item until you have finished.

        If you plan on moving the item position in the rendering
        tree, to avoid deadlock you must hold the mutex of a
        parent of all the items involved in the motion (a common
        parent of the source and target parent). This mutex has to
        be locked before you lock any mutex of your child item
        if this item is already in the rendering tree (to avoid
        deadlock with the rendering thread).
        If you are unsure and plans to move an item already
        in the rendering tree, it is thus best to lock the viewport
        mutex first.

        Input argument:
            - wait (default = False): if locking the mutex fails (mutex
            held by another thread), wait it is released

        Returns: True if the mutex is held, False else.

        The mutex is a recursive mutex, thus you can lock it several

        attach them to the tree in a second phase.

        holds a reference to its children. Thus to be release memory

            - Remove the item from the tree, remove all your references.
            If the item has children or siblings, the item will not be
            released until Python's garbage collection detects a
            circular reference.

            the item's children, thus allowing them to be removed from
            memory as soon as the user doesn't hold a reference on them.

        This property accepts a 2D numpy array or array-like object of uint8 values
        that defines how mouse interactions behave across different regions of the window.
        This is particularly useful for creating custom window borders when window.decorated=False.

        The values in the array determine how each region responds to mouse interactions:
        - 0: Normal region (default behavior, passes clicks through)
        - 1: Top resize border
        - 2: Left resize border

        - 9: Top-right resize corner
        - 12: Bottom-right resize corner
        - 15: Draggable region (window can be moved by dragging)

        The array is extended to cover the entire window area, where the extension
        is performed at the center of the window, not at the edges. Thus you only
        need to define the behaviour for the border regions, for which a small
        surface is enough. There is no need to send a new surface if the viewport

    Required Methods:
        check_can_bind(self, item):
            Must return a boolean indicating if this handler can be bound to the target item.
            Use isinstance() to check item types.

            Must return a boolean indicating if the watched condition is met.
            Should only check state, not perform actions.

        run(self, item) (Optional):
            If implemented, handles the response when conditions are met.
            Even with run() implemented, check_status() is still required.

    Warning:
        DO NOT modify item parent/sibling/child relationships during rendering.

    elements, the (0, 0) coordinate starts at the top left of the DrawWindow
    and y increases when going down. The drawing region is clipped by the
    available width/height of the item (set manually, or deduced).

    An invisible button is created to span the entire drawing area, which is
    used to retrieve button states on the area (hovering, active, etc). If set,
    the callback is called when the mouse is pressed inside the area with any
    of the left, middle or right button. In addition, the use of an invisible
    button enables the drag and drop behaviour proposed by imgui.

    If you intend on dragging elements inside the drawing area, you can either
    implement yourself a hovering test for your specific items and use the
    context's is_mouse_dragging, or add invisible buttons on top of the elements
    you want to interact with, and combine the active and mouse dragging handlers.
    Note if you intend to make an element draggable that way, you must not make
    the element source of a Drag and Drop, as it impacts the hovering tests.

    Note that Drawing items do not have any hovering/clicked/visible/etc tests

class DrawInvisibleButton(drawingItem):
    """
    Invisible rectangular area, parallel to axes, behaving
    like a button (using imgui default handling of buttons).

    Unlike other Draw items, this item accepts handlers and callbacks.

    DrawInvisibleButton can be overlapped on top of each other. In that
    case only one will be considered hovered. This one corresponds to the
    last one of the rendering tree that is hovered. If the button is
    considered active (see below), it retains the hover status to itself.
    Thus if you drag an invisible button on top of items later in the
    rendering tree, they will not be considered hovered.

    Note that only the mouse button(s) that trigger activation will
    have the above described behaviour for hover tests. If the mouse
    doesn't hover anymore the item, it will remain active as long
    as the configured buttons are pressed.

    When inside a plot, drag deltas are returned in plot coordinates,
    that is the deltas correspond to the deltas you must apply
    to your drawing coordinates compared to their original position
    to apply the dragging. When not in a plot, the drag deltas are
    in screen coordinates, and you must convert yourself to drawing
    coordinates if you are applying matrix transforms to your data.
    Generally matrix transforms are not well supported by
    DrawInvisibleButtons, and the shifted position that is updated
    during dragging might be invalid.

    Dragging handlers will not be triggered if the item is not active
    (unlike normal imgui items).

    If you create a DrawInvisibleButton in front of the mouse while
    the mouse is clicked with one of the activation buttons, it will
    steal hovering and activation tests. This is not the case of other
    gui items (except modal windows).

    If your Draw Button is not part of a window (ViewportDrawList),
    the hovering test might not be reliable (except specific case above).

    DrawInvisibleButton accepts children. In that case, the children
    are drawn relative to the coordinates of the DrawInvisibleButton,
    where top left is (0, 0) and bottom right is (1, 1).

    A container for multiple handlers that can be attached to an item.

    This handler allows grouping multiple handlers together and optionally

    The callback can be triggered based on three conditions:
    - ALL: All child handlers' states must be true (default)
    - ANY: At least one child handler's state must be true
    - NONE: No child handler's states are true

        One use case is to skip expensive check_status() calls from CustomHandlers.

        the status of further children is not checked.

        Rendering starts from the viewport. Then recursively each child
        is rendered from the first to the last, and each child renders

        Only an item inserted in the rendering tree is rendered.
        An item that is not in the rendering tree can have children.

        holds a reference to its children. Thus to be release memory
        held by an item, two options are possible:
            - Remove the item from the tree, remove all your references.
            If the item has children or siblings, the item will not be
            released until Python's garbage collection detects a
            circular reference.
            - Use delete_item to remove the item from the tree, and remove
            all the internal references inside the item structure and
            the item's children, thus allowing them to be removed from
            memory as soon as the user doesn't hold a reference on them.

        Note the viewport is referenced by the context.

        If you set this attribute, the item will be inserted at the last
        position of the children of the parent (regardless whether this
        item is already a child of the parent).

class TabBar(uiItem):

    A container for Tab and TabButton elements that creates a tabbed interface.

    TabBar provides a horizontal row of clickable tabs that can be used to switch
    between different content panels. Each tab corresponds to a Tab widget child
    that contains its own content.

    The tab bar supports various interactive behaviors including tab reordering,
    scrolling, and automatic selection. It can also be styled using themes to
    match the overall look of your application.

    Tab elements within the TabBar can contain any UI components, allowing complex
    layouts to be organized into a compact, user-friendly interface. Only the
    content of the currently selected tab is visible, while other tab contents are
    hidden until selected.

        Parent of the item in the rendering tree.

        Rendering starts from the viewport. Then recursively each child
        is rendered from the first to the last, and each child renders
        their subtree.

        Only an item inserted in the rendering tree is rendered.
        An item that is not in the rendering tree can have children.
        Thus it is possible to build and configure various items, and
        attach them to the tree in a second phase.

        The children hold a reference to their parent, and the parent
        holds a reference to its children. Thus to be release memory
        held by an item, two options are possible:
            - Remove the item from the tree, remove all your references.
            If the item has children or siblings, the item will not be
            released until Python's garbage collection detects a
            circular reference.
            - Use delete_item to remove the item from the tree, and remove
            all the internal references inside the item structure and
            the item's children, thus allowing them to be removed from
            memory as soon as the user doesn't hold a reference on them.

        Note the viewport is referenced by the context.

        If you set this attribute, the item will be inserted at the last
        position of the children of the parent (regardless whether this
        item is already a child of the parent).
        If you set None, the item will be removed from its parent's children
        list.

            - Remove the item from the tree, remove all your references.
            If the item has children or siblings, the item will not be
            released until Python's garbage collection detects a

            the item's children, thus allowing them to be removed from
            memory as soon as the user doesn't hold a reference on them.
